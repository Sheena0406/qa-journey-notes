### AWS Practitioner
- Database
  - Relational Database: row-oriented. E.g. RDS (relational database service), Aurora
  - Non-relational Database. E.g. DynamoDB
  - Data warehouse: column-oriented, for analyzing. E.g. Redshift
- Cloud native networking service
  - VPC: virtual private cloud. Logically isolated AWS network where you can launch your AWS resources.
  - NACL: network access control list. Can set both Deny/Allow rules.
  - Security Group: can only set Allow rules
  - CloudFront: Content delivery network service. Cache your data at each location to reduce delivery latency. Can set geographic restrictions, and restrict data from exposing at certain countries or regions.
- EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud
  - Highly configurable **virtual server/machine** with resizable compute capacity (since EC2 is basically a service you use to perform computations.)
  - How to launch?
    - (1) Choose OS via AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Red hat, Ubuntu, Linux
    - (2) Choose Instance type: t2.nano, c4.8xlarge
    - (3) Add Storage: SSD, HDD, virtual machine tape
    - (4) Configure instance: security groups, key pairs, userdata, IAM roles
  - EC2 Tenancy
    - Dedicated host: your server lives on the entire physical
    - Dedicated instance: your server lives on a certain slot of the server rack. fixed slot.
    - Default instance: your server is guarantee on the server rack, but is not fixed slot. You will know where your server resides once your instance is launched. (So can be different at each reboot.)
  - Elastic IP address
  - Launch template: preconfigure and save image (AMI) to allow yourself to launch the same EC2 instances.
  - 4 types of load balancer: application load balancer, network load balancer, gateway load balancer, classic load balancer.
  - Load balancer v.s. target group v.s auto-scaling group
  - EC2 pricing models
    - on-demand
    - spot
    - reserved
    - dedicated
    - saving plans
